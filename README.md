# Covid-19-Global-Vaccination-Tracker-Dashboard

This is the visual presentation of my Global Covid-19 Vaccination Tracker Interactive Dashboard made on Tableau. 
This dashboard presents some key metrics related to Vaccination programs across countries in the world.

Some of the KPIs include Partially Vaccinated, Fully Vaccinated and Non-Vaccinated People.
It also shows a correlation between the GDP of the countries and the amount of vaccinations that have been done respectively.

The dashboard allows filtering by Continents, Countries, and Dates.
